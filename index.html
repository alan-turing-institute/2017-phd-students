        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>After a BSc in Physics at Imperial and a year as a travelling salesman in Australia, I
        	worked an analyst and software developer for 5 years, eventually running my
        	own team. While enjoying my time in industry, I wanted to work on problems
        	no one had solved before, so I went back to school - first to a master's in
        	artificial intelligence at Edinburgh and then to a PhD in computational
        	neuroscience at UCL.</p>

    	<p>Enjoying the research environment but frustrated with
        	the slow pace, superspecialisation and precarious nature of the academic career
        	path, I went back to industry for 3 years as an independent software development
        	consultant. Last November, I discovered research software engineering and the
        	Turing and now marry all my professional interests running the software
        	engineering half of the Turing's Research
        	Engineering team.</p>

        <h3>Research interests</h3>
        <p class="research_interests">Learning Theory; Optimization; Deep Learning; Adversarial Models; </p>
        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I have an undergraduate degree from IIT Kanpur with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor in Linguistics Theory. During these four years, I visited quite a few places where I carried out short term research projects. I spent some time in Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Following that I spent a summer at the Amazon ML lab in Bangalore where I worked on developing a model in competitive pricing, which was later deployed(supposedly). I spent the next summer in the Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms(MILA) where I worked on developing an adaptive segmentation language generation model, which was published at the MLSLP workshop at ICML, Sydney. I spent the following summer at the Twitter Cortex group in NYC working with Nicholas Leonard and Nicolas Koumchatzky woking on adversarial discrete sequence generation models.

	Currently, I am a doctoral student in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Oxford where I am supervised by Dr. Varun Kanade and Dr. Phil Torr from the Engineering Scienec department. I also active engage in coding and contributing to open source libraries, which is available in my github repository. I am also interested in Brazilian Ji-Jitsu and board games. </p>

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am a second year PhD student working under the supervision of Graham Cormode on the project 'Small Summaries for Big Data'.
          This year I will be based at the Alan Turing Institute for Data Science.
          Previously, I studied for my Mathematics MSci at the University of Birmingham.</p>

  <p>Currently, we are studying randomised algorithms for fundamental matrix computations and related problems.
          This is a vibrant area of research using ideas from fundamental topics in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. Such methods will be useful in developing algorithms for big data which is becoming ubiquitous in applications.</p>

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I did my undergraduate degree in economics and finance in University College Dublin, and subsequently did a
          Masters in statistics in UCD also. I then worked for three years with the Economic and Social Research Institute,
          within the health research team where I worked on projects like comparing mortality rates of Irish hospitals and
        assessing the financial impact of a proposed plan to introduce Universal Health Insurance in Ireland. I then started
        my PhD in the OxWaSP CDT as a student of the university of Warwick.
